    <h1>I like to explore and create...</h1>

    <p>
        I am a mechanical engineer with expertise in robotic and mechatronic systems. I have studied for my BSc at the Iran University
         of Science and Technology (IUST) and my MSc at the University of Tehran. My research interests include control systems, robotics
          and soft robotics, mechatronics, mechanical design, and soft sensors. My passion for research and my interest in experimental 
          studies have always pushed me to pursue my studies with practicality in mind. I have always believed that man's ability is only
           limited to his technologies, and my vision is to use the knowledge I have gained in my experiences to make an impact in the 
           healthcare industry, to research novel biomedical devices.
    </p>

    <p>
        In my professional career as a researcher, I have been a part of some of the best teams I had access to. I have been proud to
         be a part of the Biomechatronic and Cognitive Engineering laboratory (BACE) at IUST, the Center of Advanced Systems and 
         Technologies at the University of Tehran, and I have collaborated with the Healthcare Mechatronics laboratory at the University
          of Leeds.
    </p>

    <p>
        My passion to build is what defines me. I not only strive to study theory, but I am eager to use the theoretical knowledge to produce 
        tangible results. Please take a look at my projects to get familiar with my expertise and my interests.
    </p>
