I have been a member of various teams throughout my career and voluntary work. Below is a brief summary of these teams, their purpose, and my role within them.

## SURENA V Humanoid Robot Team
One of the most renowned robotic teams in Iran, this team is based in the Center of Advanced Systems and Technologies (CAST). The team has developed 6 humanoid robots until now, and is working on the next robot which is the last and most advanced humanoid of the SURENA series. The robot is named after an Iranian Legendary hero, and it designed with its own personality. This robot introduces novel controllers, machine vision for the robot to have environmental perception, and AI algorithms to make the robot intelligent.  
Due to my hands-on experience, my main role in this team is to design and build parts for the robot and to maintain and repair the robot. I work with 3D printers and CNC machines to produce parts and assemble different sections. I have also collaborate on a couple publications on the research conducted on the robot.
