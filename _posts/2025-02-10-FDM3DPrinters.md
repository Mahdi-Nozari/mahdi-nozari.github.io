description: "3D printers are typically my first choice when I am thinking about making an experimental setup. They are easy to use and flexible to produce parts with."

As I have been passionate about making, I have always liked tools. I try to gather different tools so I can complete my projects more effectively. 3D printers have been an important part of my journey, and I have enjoyed designing and making them, as well as using them for my projects. Here are shown the 3D printers I have made so far. Please also visit the page for the [large-scale delta printer](/posts/Delta3DPrinter/) I have made!
