Medical imaging plays a critical role in modern healthcare, particularly in high-precision procedures like spinal and neurosurgery. Traditional imaging systems often require patient repositioning, which can be time-consuming and introduce risks of misalignment. Additionally, frequent exposure to X-rays poses health hazards to medical staff. In response to these challenges, I have developed a portable ring-shaped imaging apparatus that offers a solution by providing motorized, 360-degree imaging with remote control capabilities.

This device eliminates the need for patient movement by capturing images from all angles with its motorized gantry and automated control system. Unlike conventional imaging solutions that require manual adjustments or limited rotational capability, this apparatus ensures precise, uninterrupted imaging, reducing operational time and enhancing surgical accuracy. Furthermore, the ability to remotely control the device minimizes direct X-ray exposure for surgeons and healthcare providers, significantly improving workplace safety.

One of the most important features of this device is its real-time 3D reconstruction capability. By capturing a sequence of images and using algorithms such as Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF), the system generates detailed 3D models that can be used for surgical planning, robotic-assisted operations, and real-time motion compensation. This advancement is particularly valuable in minimally invasive and robotic surgeries, where real-time visualization can be valuable for precision and success.

As the medical field continues to embrace automation and robotics, portable, intelligent imaging solutions like this will become indispensable. By combining efficiency, safety, and accuracy, this technology has the potential to redefine the standards of intraoperative imaging, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes and enhanced surgical workflows.
