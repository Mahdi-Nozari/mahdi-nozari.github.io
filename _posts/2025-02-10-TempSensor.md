description: "Calibration and data acquisition of a PDMS-based biosensor for monitoring body temperature with a portable wristband"
---
This study presents the development of a wristband to read the data from a novel biocompatible wearable temperature sensor, which monitors the temperature of the body by resistive changes. The sensor is first calibrated and characterized using a temperature-controlled heatbed. With the calibration curve extracted, all components, such as the signal conditioning circuit and the microcontroller, can be fit inside a 3D-printed enclosure in the shape of a wristband for portability.
