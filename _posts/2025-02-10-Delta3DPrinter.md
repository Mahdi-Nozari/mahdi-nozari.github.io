description: "A part of a bigger project for the digitization of the manufacturing process of braces for children with scoliosis"

Scoliosis, is a condition where the spine is curved and it is often diagnosed in young ages. It has been said that it is most curable if it is treated before the age of 18. The common and effective treatment for this disorder is for the patient to wear certain braces fabricated by a doctor. However, because the process is entirely manually, the braces are often hard and time consuming to build, and even sometimes they have to be remade. Moreover, typical patients might need several braces as the spine will curved back to it's normal shape.  
To help the professionals with this treatment, the entire process can be digitalized so that the physicians can get help from the processing power of computers and technology to scan the body of the patient, design the braces, and fabricate them using 3D printing. This way, the process can be done with less errors and much more rapidly.  
As a part of a bigger project to develop this entire process for the Iran Red Crescent Society, I have designed and build an FDM delta printer specially for this braces. The printer is designed so it can print braces even for teenagers, and it is easy to use and maintain. It features sturdy frame made out of metal sheets, and has been optimized with FEM software to withstand vibrations while working.
